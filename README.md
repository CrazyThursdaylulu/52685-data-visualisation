# 52685-data-visualisation

## Project Explanation
	This project is in accordance to the last few proposals that I have made and I went through it according to what I understand and reached in my potential for data and coding literacy. With this, I designed a Jupyter notebook-based web interface that showcases a database for carbon units between various countries between the years 1990-2020. It showcases the type of gases that are existing within the countryâ€™s atmosphere. It has a few graphs, few user interfaces, and clickable choices to generate a graph based on the paradigm that was chosen. It used line and histograms since it has long-ranged timeframe.
